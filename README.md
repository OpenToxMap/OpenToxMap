# OpenToxMap

As reported in this [blog](https://envirodatagov.org/goodbye-to-toxmap-and-our-environmental-right-to-know/)the National Library of Medicine is retiring the ToxMap site. This site combined data from multiple sources to give a detailed, up to date map of toxic releases in the US.

This repo and organization are the central resource for building an open replacement for ToxMap so that this resource lives on.

### Tasks

- [ ] Identify each of the datasets used in ToxMap
- [ ] Find alternatives for each, preferably as a REST service or other API but failing that as data that can be downloaded and ingested into a database / API
- [ ] Identify main functionality of the old site and prioritize features
- [ ] Develop a front end application using open tools (React/Leaflet/OpenLayers/MapboxGL etc) to implement the most important features
- [ ] Develop any supporting back end infrastructure required (though we should try to keep this to a minimum)

### Data Sources

ToxMap uses a lot of different data sources. We will need to identify each and find alternatives. We are coordinating that effort in the github wiki on this repo. Head to the [datasets page](https://github.com/OpenToxMap/OpenToxMap/wiki/Datasets) to see the progress of this task and to find out how to contribute

### Features

In addition to the data sources, we will need to determine what features from the original ToxMap project we want to replicate and to prioritize work on these. We will do this through the [Features](https://github.com/OpenToxMap/OpenToxMap/wiki/Features) wiki page

### How to get involved

We need as many people as possible to help out to get this resource back online. If you want to help out, you can contribute to the wiki, to code or documentation.
